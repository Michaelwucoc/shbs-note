1. Smart Door Lock System:

To design a logic circuit for the door lock system, we can use OR gates. The door should unlock if a valid key card is swiped (K = 1) or if the button from inside is pressed (B = 1).

The logic circuit representation for the door lock system can be achieved as follows:
- Connect the output of the key card sensor (K) to one input of an OR gate.
- Connect the output of the button sensor (B) to the other input of the OR gate.
- The output of the OR gate is the output of the logic circuit, representing whether the door should unlock.

Logic Circuit:
Output = K OR B

2. Automated Farm Watering System:

To design a logic circuit for the watering system, we can use AND, OR, and NOT gates. The watering system should turn on when the soil is dry (S = 1) and it's not raining (R = 0), or when the timer is active (T = 1). However, if it's raining (R = 1), the system should only water the crops if other conditions are good.

The logic circuit representation for the watering system can be achieved as follows:
- Connect the output of the rain sensor (R) to one input of a NOT gate.
- Connect the output of the soil moisture sensor (S) to one input of an AND gate.
- Connect the output of the timer (T) to the other input of the AND gate.
- Connect the output of the NOT gate and the output of the AND gate to the inputs of an OR gate. The output of this OR gate is the output of the logic circuit, representing whether the watering system should turn on.

Logic Circuit:
Output = (NOT R AND S) OR T

3. Smart Garage System:

To design a logic circuit for the garage system, we can use OR gates. The garage door should open or close if a vehicle is detected (V = 1) or if the remote control is activated (C = 1).

The logic circuit representation for the garage system can be achieved as follows:
- Connect the output of the vehicle sensor (V) to one input of an OR gate.
- Connect the output of the remote control (C) to the other input of the OR gate.
- The output of the OR gate is the output of the logic circuit, representing whether the garage door should open or close.

Logic Circuit:
Output = V OR C

4. Classroom Lighting Control:

To design a logic circuit for the lighting control system, we can use AND, OR, and NOT gates. The lights should turn on when someone is in the classroom (P = 1) and there isn't sufficient daylight (D = 0), or when the manual switch is turned on (S = 1).

The logic circuit representation for the lighting control system can be achieved as follows:
- Connect the output of the presence sensor (P) to one input of an AND gate.
- Connect the output of the daylight sensor (D) to the other input of the AND gate.
- Connect the output of the manual switch (S) to one input of an OR gate.
- Connect the output of the AND gate and the output of the OR gate to the inputs of another OR gate. The output of this OR gate is the output of the logic circuit, representing whether the lights should turn on.

Logic Circuit:
Output = (P AND NOT D) OR S

5. Home Security System:

To design a logic circuit for the home security system, we can use OR gates. The alarm should activate if either a window is opened (W = 1) or a door is opened (D = 1).

The logic circuit representation for the home security system can be achieved as follows:
- Connect the output of the window sensor (W) to one input of an OR gate.
- Connect the output of the door sensor (D) to the other input of the OR gate.
- The output of the OR gate is the output of the logic circuit, representing whether the alarm should activate.

Logic Circuit:
Output = W OR D
