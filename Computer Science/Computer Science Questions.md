## Boolean Logic/Boolean Algebra

### Question 1: Fitness Center Access Control - 8 points

In a fitness center, there's an access control system controlled by two inputs:

- **M**: Membership card sensor. Outputs "1" when a valid membership card is swiped and "0" otherwise.
    
- **S**: Staff key card sensor. Outputs "1" when a valid staff key card is swiped and "0" otherwise.
    

The door should unlock if either a valid membership card is swiped or a staff key card is swiped.

Using AND, OR, and NOT gates, design a logic circuit that represents this access control system. Specify the output in terms of **M** and **S**.

### Question 2: Library Lighting System - 8 points

In a public library, there's an automatic lighting system with two inputs:

- **P**: Presence sensor. Outputs "1" when a person is detected in the library and "0" otherwise.
    
- **C**: Clock. Outputs "1" during library operating hours and "0" otherwise.
    

The lights should turn on if it's during operating hours and someone is present.

Using AND, OR, and NOT gates, design a logic circuit for this lighting system. Specify the output in terms of **P** and **C**.

### Question 3: Hospital Emergency Door System - 8 points

In a hospital, there's an emergency door system with three inputs:

- **E**: Emergency button. Outputs "1" when pressed and "0" otherwise.
    
- **A**: Ambulance sensor. Outputs "1" when an ambulance is detected and "0" otherwise.
    
- **F**: Fire alarm sensor. Outputs "1" when the fire alarm is activated and "0" otherwise.
    

The door should open if either the emergency button is pressed, an ambulance is detected, or the fire alarm is activated.

Using AND, OR, and NOT gates, design a logic circuit for this door system. Specify the output in terms of **E**, **A**, and **F**.

### Question 4: Air Conditioning Control - 8 points

In an office building, there's an air conditioning system controlled by two inputs:

- **T**: Temperature sensor. Outputs "1" when the temperature is above a set level and "0" otherwise.
    
- **H**: Humidity sensor. Outputs "1" when the humidity is above a certain percentage and "0" otherwise.
    

The air conditioning should turn on when the temperature is high or the humidity is high.

Using AND, OR, and NOT gates, design a logic circuit that represents this air conditioning control system. Specify the output in terms of **T** and **H**.

### Question 5: Train Crossing Gate System - 8 points

At a railway crossing, there's a gate control system with two inputs:

- **R**: Railway sensor. Outputs "1" when a train is approaching and "0" otherwise.
    
- **M**: Manual override. Outputs "1" when activated by a station master and "0" otherwise.
    

The gate should close when a train is approaching or when manually overridden.

Using AND, OR, and NOT gates, design a logic circuit for this train crossing gate system. Specify the output in terms of **R** and **M**.
