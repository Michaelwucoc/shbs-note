The `:=` operator is known as the "walrus operator" in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.8 and is officially called the "assignment expression." This operator is used for assignment expressions, allowing you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression.

The primary use case for the walrus operator is to simplify code where you want to both compute a value and use it in a conditional expression. It is particularly useful in while-loops and list comprehensions.

Here's a simple example:

```python
# Without the walrus operator
n = 10
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1

# With the walrus operator
n = 10
while (n := n - 1) > 0:
    print(n)
```

In the second example, the assignment `(n := n - 1)` both decrements `n` and returns the new value. This value is then used in the conditional expression of the `while` loop.

It's important to note that while the walrus operator can make certain code more concise, it should be used judiciously to maintain readability. Excessive use of assignment expressions within complex expressions might make the code less clear.
