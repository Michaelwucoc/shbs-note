1. **What is an algorithm?**
    - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules for solving a specific problem or accomplishing a particular task.
2. **Give the algorithm for making a cup of coffee.**
    - The algorithm for making a cup of coffee would involve a series of steps like boiling water, adding coffee grounds, and possibly sugar or milk, stirring,emmmmmmm.
3. **Can an algorithm execute forever?**
    - No, by definition.
4. **What is a computer program?**
    - A computer program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.
5. **What are the three parties involved in an algorithm?**
    - Are the input, the algorithm itself, and the output.
6. **What are the three stages that make up a computer program?**
    - Input, processing, and output.
7. **Can a computer program be made up of two stages?**
    - No.
8. **What is meant by the term “reserved words”?**
    - Reserved words are words in a programming language that have a specific meaning and cannot be used for other purposes, such as variable names.
9. **What is a syntax error? Give one example.**
    - A syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language. Example: `print(Hello Poseidon)` should be `print("Hello Poseidon")`.
10. **What is a logic error? Give one example.**
    - A logic error occurs when the code is syntactically correct but does not produce the expected output due to a mistake in the logical flow. Example: Incorrect conditional statement.
11. **What is a runtime error? Give one example.**
    - A runtime error occurs during the execution of a program. Example: Division by zero.
12. **What type of error is caused by a misspelled keyword, a missing punctuation character, or a missing closing bracket?**
    - `Syntax error.`
13. **What does the term “debugging” mean?**
    - Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a program.
14. **Why should a programmer add comments in his or her code?**
    - To themselves and others know what they are writing..
