To calculate the displacement of the car from the point of origin, we need to break down the distances and directions into horizontal and vertical components.

Let's start by drawing a diagram using text symbols:

```
                |
                |   98km
                |       \
                |         \
                |           \
                |             \
                |------------\
        225km   |     X       \
                |             \
                |               \
                |----------------\
                |
```

In the diagram above, the point X represents the point of origin. The car first travels 225km west, represented by the horizontal line. Then it moves 98km in a southwest direction, which is a combination of vertical and horizontal movement.

To calculate the displacement, we can find the horizontal and vertical components separately and then combine them.

Horizontal component from the 225km west movement: -225km (to the left on the x-axis)

Vertical component from the 98km southwest movement:
To find the vertical component, we need to find the projection of 98km at a 45-degree angle. The angle forms a right triangle with the vertical and horizontal components as the perpendicular and base, respectively. In a right triangle, the vertical component is calculated using the formula: sin(angle) = perpendicular / hypotenuse.

Using this formula, the vertical component is calculated as follows:

sin(45 degrees) = vertical component / 98km

vertical component = sin(45 degrees) * 98km = 69.296km

Therefore, the vertical component from the 98km southwest movement is approximately 69.296km.

To find the displacement, we add the horizontal and vertical components:

Horizontal displacement: -225km
Vertical displacement: 69.296km

Displacement = √((-225km)^2 + (69.296km)^2) ≈ 235.39km

Therefore, the displacement of the car from the point of origin is approximately 235.39km.
