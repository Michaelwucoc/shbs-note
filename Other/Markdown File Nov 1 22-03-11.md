# Things you need to know
- I trust you and **Please Don't say anything about THIS DOCUMENT** to Jack and someone else. If you do so, I will be very disappointed and not trust you anymore.
- The content may have some arguments or something not told clearly. I would be very happy if you pointed it out.
- I'll be honest, you probably won't feel anything when you read it, you might think I'm childish or something, and you should know the big picture, so think about what I'm trying to say.
# Point 1 You may need to be aware of the extent.
I've recently noticed that there are **small groups of people uploading or sharing some photos of you and Jack** (I won't go into detail here, I'm afraid this information could be exploited)
The photos I'm talking about include but are not limited to the following: photos of two people being intimate or some behavioural photos.
You need to pay attention that some of the detailed photos have been uploaded to the Student Affairs Office. You should make some changes.
# Point 2 some questions related to Jack
- I had recently noticed that Jack was in an irregular state, and as a relatively close friend to him, I didn't want him to be affected in any way. I would love or ask for your help in asking for clarification on what is going on with Jack. I know he has his plans, but I'm worried about the way he's been acting all day in his private life.
- Also, it's today, it should be yesterday by the time you're reading it. I didn't understand why Jack was so sensitive to you, I didn't want to think in a direction that wasn't positive. I hope you can find some free time to discuss this clearly with me, I would love to help him as much as he has helped me.
# Ending
Overall, I've spent a lot of time on this document and thank you for being able to read it. I'm happy to help with any questions.
