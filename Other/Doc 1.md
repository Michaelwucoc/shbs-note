在现代汉语中，“作文”指的是用文字表达思想、感情或观点的行为，通常是指学生按照一定的题目、要求和规范，用文字来表达自己的思考和观点的活动。它是一个名词，表示一种行为或活动。

与“作文”相比，“做文”这个词组在现代汉语中并不常见。如果硬要给它一个解释的话，可能可以理解为“制作文稿”的意思，强调了文章的创作过程中的制作或准备活动。不过需要注意的是，这个词组在现代汉语中并不被广泛使用，所以它的定义和用法较为模糊。

原文中的“属予作文以记之”使用了动词短语“作文”，表示岳阳楼作者属下交给他写作，并以此来记录的意思。这里的“作文”是动词，表示创作或写作的行为。

总结起来，现代汉语中的“作文”指的是用文字表达思想的活动，是一个名词；而“做文”在现代汉语中用法较少，可能可以理解为“制作文稿”的意思，强调文章创作过程中的制作或准备活动。在原文中，“作文”是动词，表示写作的行为。


1. In the case of a coasting bike rider traveling at 25 km/h on a flat roadway, there are several forces acting on the rider. The primary forces involved are:
- Weight or gravitational force (mg): This force acts vertically downwards towards the center of the Earth.
- Normal force (N): This force acts perpendicular to the surface of the road and counteracts the force of gravity.
- Friction force (f): This force acts parallel to the surface of the road, in the opposite direction of the bike's motion. It is responsible for slowing down the bike's motion.

Since the bike is coasting, there is no input of external force, such as pedaling. As a result, the net force acting on the rider is zero. The forces of weight and normal force balance each other, and the friction force counters the forward motion of the bike.

2. On a spaceship traveling away from Earth towards the Moon, your weight would change with time due to the changing gravitational field. As you move away from Earth, the gravitational force acting on you decreases, resulting in a decrease in your weight.

However, it is important to note that weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it is directly proportional to the mass of the object. Therefore, your mass would remain constant throughout the journey, as mass is an intrinsic property of an object and does not change with location or acceleration.

3. The force of air resistance, also known as drag, depends on an object's speed. As an object moves through a fluid medium, such as air, it experiences resistance due to the collision between the object and the air molecules.

At low speeds, air resistance is relatively small because there are fewer collisions between the object and air molecules. However, as the speed of the object increases, the number of collisions and the force of air resistance also increase. This is because at higher speeds, the object pushes more air molecules aside, resulting in a larger force opposing the motion.

The relationship between air resistance and speed is generally modeled by the equation F_air = 0.5 * p * A * C_d * v^2, where F_air is the force of air resistance, p is the density of the fluid (air), A is the reference area of the object, C_d is the drag coefficient, and v is the velocity/speed of the object.

4. When a car slows down and turns right, the net force acting on the car can be inferred based on the following considerations:

- The car experiences a deceleration or negative acceleration in the direction of the car's motion. This deceleration is caused by the brakes and the friction between the tires and the road.
- The car also experiences a centrifugal force or a force pushing the car towards the outside of the turn. This force is due to the inertia of the car trying to maintain its straight-line motion while the car turns.

Combining these forces, the net force acting on the car can be inferred to be a combination of the deceleration force in the forward direction and the centrifugal force towards the outside of the turn.

5. The motion of the box being pushed by three students will change under the following conditions:

- If the net force exerted by the three students in one direction is greater than the force of friction between the box and the surface, the box will accelerate in that direction.
- If the net force exerted by the three students in one direction is equal to the force of friction, the box will move at a constant velocity in that direction.
- If the net force exerted by the three students in one direction is less than the force of friction, the box will decelerate and eventually come to a stop.

It's important to note that changes in motion depend on the balance of forces acting on the box. If the force of friction is negligible or absent, and there are no external forces acting on the box, then any net force exerted by the students will result in an acceleration or change in motion of the box.

6. To calculate the net force acting on a car with a mass of 1,500 kg and an acceleration of 2.0 m/s², we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that net force (F_net) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a), expressed as F_net = m * a.


Substituting the given values into the equation:

F_net = 1,500 kg * 2.0 m/s²

F_net = 3,000 kg⋅m/s²

Therefore, the net force acting on the car is 3,000 N.

7. To calculate the mass of a softball that has an acceleration of 1,500 m/s² when struck by a bat with a net force of 300 N, we can use Newton's second law of motion, F_net = m * a, where F_net is the net force, m is the mass, and a is
8. We are given:

Net force (F_net) = 300 N Acceleration (a) = 1,500 m/s²

Using Newton's second law of motion, F_net = m * a, we can rearrange the equation to solve for mass (m):

m = F_net / a

Substituting the given values:

m = 300 N / 1,500 m/s²

m = 0.2 kg

Therefore, the mass of the softball is 0.2 kg.
