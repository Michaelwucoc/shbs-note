Improving Dormitory Kitchen Use

I've noticed that most students don't use the dormitory kitchens, which is unfortunate since students would probably enjoy preparing their own food. I think that the university should make improvements to the dormitory kitchens so that they will be more widely used. There are a few things that the university could do to encourage students to start using the kitchens regularly. First: I think the kitchens should be modernized with new cookware for students to use. Also, I think free cooking classes should be given to stimulate students' interest in cooking and make them want to use the kitchens.
