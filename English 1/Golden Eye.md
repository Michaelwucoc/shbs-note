- Creating a futuristic and weird world without any connection to the real world.
- This results in a lack of emotional connection between the audience and the story world.

[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOEQMhbFCU&t=56) Science fiction is not about predicting the future
- This is the most common mistake that writers make about science fiction
- Nobody cares if you can actually predict what the world is going to be like in the year 2500. We're all going to be dead by then.

[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOEQMhbFCU&t=90) Science fiction is a commentary on the present world.
