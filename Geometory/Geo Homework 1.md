1. **A(0, 2), B(2, 4), C(4, 2), D(2, 0):**
   - The slopes of $AB$ and $CD$ are both $1$, and the slopes of $BC$ and $AD$ are both $-1$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of $AB$ and $BC$ are equal, making it a rhombus.

2. **D(-2, 1), E(-1, 3), F(3, 1), G(2, -1):**
   - The slopes of $DE$ and $FG$ are both $0.5$, and the slopes of $EF$ and $GD$ are both $-0.5$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of $DE$ and $FG$ are equal, making it a rhombus.

3. **A(-2, -1), B(0, 2), C(2, -1), D(0, -4):**
   - The slopes of $AB$ and $CD$ are both $-1.5$, and the slopes of $BC$ and $AD$ are both $1.5$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of $AB$ and $BC$ are equal, making it a rhombus.

4. **A(-3, 0), B(-1, 3), C(5, -1), D(3, -4):**
   - The slopes of $AB$ and $CD$ are both $-0.5$, and the slopes of $BC$ and $AD$ are both $0.5$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of $AB$ and $BC$ are not necessarily equal, so it's not a rhombus.

5. **S(-1, 4), T(3, 2), U(1, -2), V(-3, 0):**
   - The slopes of $ST$ and $UV$ are both $-0.5$, and the slopes of TU and SV are both $2$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of $ST$ and $UV$ are not necessarily equal, so it's not a rhombus.

6. **F(-1, 0), G(1, 3), H(4, 1), I(2, -2):**
   - The slopes of $FG$ and $HI$ are both $-\dfrac{1}{3}$, and the slopes of $GH$ and $IF$ are both $3$. This implies that the opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
   - The lengths of FG and HI are not necessarily equal, so it's not a rhombus.
7. **Square RSTU has vertices R(-3, -1), S(-1, 2), and 7(2, 0). Find the coordinates of vertex U:**

   - The diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles.
   - The midpoint of $RS$ is $(-2, 0)$, and the midpoint of $TU$ is also $(-2, 0)$.
   - The slope of $RS$ is $\dfrac {(2 - (-1))}{(-1 - (-3))} = \dfrac {3}{2}$, so the slope of $TU$ is $-\dfrac{2}{3}$ (negative reciprocal).
 - Using the midpoint and slope, we can find the equation of the line passing through $T$ and $U$: $y - 0 = \dfrac{(-\dfrac{2}{3})}{(x - (-2))}$.
 - Solving for $x = 2$, we get $y = -2$. Therefore, the coordinates of $U$ are $(2, -2)$.
