# 1. Perpendicular Bisectors Concurrency (Circumcenter):

**Given:** $\triangle ABC$  
**To Prove:** The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of $\triangle ABC$ intersect at a common point (circumcenter).

**Proof:**
1. **Perpendicular Bisectors:** Let $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ be the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ respectively. This means $AD \perp BC$, $BE \perp CA$, and $CF \perp AB$.

2. **Radian Distance:** Since $AD$ is perpendicular to $BC$, $BD = CD$. Similarly, $CE = AE$, and $AF = BF$.

3. **Common Point:** Consider the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. Points $B$, $C$, $E$, and $D$ lie on this circle. By the definition of a circle, $BD = CD$ implies that $D$ is equidistant from $B$ and $C$.

4. **Repeat for Other Sides:** Similarly, $E$ is equidistant from $A$ and $C$, and $F$ is equidistant from $A$ and $B$.

5. **Intersection Point:** Therefore, $D$, $E$, and $F$ are equidistant from the vertices of $\triangle ABC$, making them con-cyclic. Hence, they intersect at a common point, the circumcenter.

# 2. Angle Bisectors Concurrency (Incenter):

**Given:** $\triangle ABC$  
**To Prove:** The angle bisectors of the interior angles of $\triangle ABC$ intersect at a common point (incenter).

**Proof:**
1. **Angle Bisectors:** Let $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ be the angle bisectors of the interior angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.

2. **Angle Bisector Theorem:** By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\dfrac{BD}{DC} = \dfrac{AB}{AC}$, $\dfrac{CE}{EA} = \dfrac{BC}{BA}$, and $\dfrac{AF}{FB} = \dfrac{CA}{CB}$.

3. **Common Point:** Let $I$ be the intersection point of $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$. By the transitive property, the above ratios are equal, implying that $I$ is equidistant from the sides of $\triangle ABC$.

4. **Incenter Property:** $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ since it is equidistant from the sides.

# 3. Medians Concurrency (Centroid):

**Given:** $\triangle ABC$  
**To Prove:** The medians of $\triangle ABC$ intersect at a common point (centroid).

**Proof:**
1. **Medians:** Let $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ be the medians of $\triangle ABC$, intersecting at $G$, $H$, and $I$ respectively.

2. **Midpoints:** By the definition of medians, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $E$ is the midpoint of $CA$, and $F$ is the midpoint of $AB$.

3. **Median Property:** $G$, $H$, and $I$ divide the medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ in the ratio $2:1$.

4. **Intersection Point:** Consider $\triangle ABC$ and the medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$. The points $G$, $H$, and $I$ are trisected by the medians.

5. **Equidistance:** Since $D$, $E$, and $F$ are midpoints, $G$ is equidistant from $B$ and $C$, $H$ is equidistant from $C$ and $A$, and $I$ is equidistant from $A$ and $B$.

6. **Common Point:** Therefore, $G$, $H$, and $I$ coincide at a common point, which is the centroid of $\triangle ABC$.
