# Concept
When polygons have the same shape but may be different in size, they are called similar polygons.

**Words**: Two polygons are similar if and only if their corresponding angles are congruent and the measures of their corresponding sides are proportional. 
**Symbol**: `âˆ¼` is read is similar to
**Example**:

The order of the vertices in a similarity statement is important. It identifies the corresponding angles and the corresponding sides.

# Example
1. This is a miniature replica of a 1923 Checker Cab. The length of the model is 6.5 inches long. If the length of the car is 13 feet, what is the scale factor of the model compared to the car?
> 12 Inch = 1 Foot
> Both measurements need to have the same unit of measure.

$13(12) = 156 inches$
$\dfrac{Lengthmodel}{Lengthcar} = \dfrac{6.5inches}{156inches} or \dfrac{1}{24}$

The scale factor is $\dfrac{1}{24}$.So the model is $\dfrac{1}{24}$ the length of the real car.

2. Triangle ABC is similar to $\triangle XYZ$ with a scale factor of $\dfrac{2}{3}$ . If the sides of $\triangle ABC$ are $6$, $8$, and $10$ inches, what are the lengths of the sides of $\triangle XYZ$? Write proportions for finding side measures.
