Given: PQRS is a square with coordinates Q(-2, 8), R(5, 7), and S(4, 0).

To find the coordinates of P, let's denote P as (x, y).

The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula:
$\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

For QR:
$\text{Distance}_{QR} = \sqrt{(5 - (-2))^2 + (7 - 8)^2}$
$\text{Distance}_{QR} = \sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2}$
$\text{Distance}_{QR} = \sqrt{50}$
$\text{Distance}_{QR} = 5\sqrt{2}$

For PS:
$\text{Distance}_{PS} = \sqrt{(4 - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2}$

Since PQRS is a square, QR = PS. Therefore:
$5\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{(4 - x)^2 + y^2}$

Squaring both sides:
$50 = (4 - x)^2 + y^2$

Now, use the coordinates of points R and S to find the values of x and y.

For point R(5, 7):
$50 = (4 - 5)^2 + 7^2$
$50 = 50$

For point S(4, 0):
$50 = (4 - x)^2 + 0^2$

Now, solve for x:
$(4 - x)^2 = 50$
$x = 4 - 5\sqrt{2}$

Substitute x back into the equation for PS:
$50 = (4 - (4 - 5\sqrt{2}))^2 + y^2$
$50 = (5\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2$
$y = 0$

So, the coordinates of P are $(4 - 5\sqrt{2}, 0)$.
