**Verbal Expressions to Algebraic Expressions**: Verbal expressions can be translated into algebraic or mathematical expressions. Any letter can be used as a variable to present a number that is not known.
- A mathematical sentence containing one or more variables is called on **open-sentence**.A mathematical sentence stating that two mathematical expressions are equal is called an **equation**.
- Open sentences are either true nor false until the variables have been replaced by numbers. Each replacement that results in a true sentence is called a **solution**ã€‚
- Properties of Equality: To solve equations can use properties of equality. Some of these properties are listed below.
