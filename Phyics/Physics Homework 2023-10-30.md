 1. Substituting the given values, we get a = 60 N / 60 kg = 1 m/s^2. Therefore, the force exerted by the skateboard on you is 60 N in the opposite direction to your push.

2. According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When you jump from the boat, you exert a force on the boat in one direction, and as a result, the boat exerts an equal but opposite force on you.  

3. Newton's third law of motion explains the action and reaction forces when a hammer hits a nail. When the hammer strikes the nail, the action force is exerted by the hammer, driving the nail to the surface. At the same time, the nail exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the hammer, causing the hammer to bounce back slightly. 

5. In this scenario, according to Newton's second law of motion (F = m * a).

a1 / a2 = m2 / m1. 
a1 / a2 = (0.5 * m1) / m1 = 0.5. 
Therefore, the child will have an acceleration that is twice as large as yours.

5. 
As you push against the floor of the airliner with your feet to walk, you exert a backward force on the floor. Simultaneously, the floor exerts an equal but opposite forward force on you and pushes you forward. This interaction between forces is a result of Newton's third law.


6. In this scenario, the person exerts a force of 700 N to throw the anchor, and the total mass of the canoe and person is 100 kg. 
The acceleration can be determined using the equation: F = m * a. 
Rearranging the equation, we have a = F / m. 
Substituting the given values, we get a = 700 N / 100 kg = 7 m/s^2. 
With the help of the force,
