# Atmospheric Pressure
Earth's atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 100,000 $Pa$  at sea level due to gravity.
$$
P=\dfrac {F}{A}
$$
$$
P=Pgh
$$
*Examples:*
$Pa=1.0\times10^5Pa$
1. There is an atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water.
The liquid surface pressure can use the formula $P=Pgh_{(Depth)}$  
2. The pressure outside the tube is $P_0$ , if there is no water inside the tube, the pressure is still $P_0$, the unbalanced force experienced, so the water in the bottle grows up.
$mg=P_0A$
$pVg=P_0A$
$phAg=P_0A so phg=P_0$
$(1.0\times10^3kg/m^3)h(10m/s^3)=1.0\times10^4Pa$
$h=10m$
