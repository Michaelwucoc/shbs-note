1. Like lifting an object, from the floor to a shelf. When I exert force to let the box be against of the gravity, the work is done on the object, changing its position in the gravitational field.
2. Power (P) is defined as the rate of doing work, and it is given by the formula $P=\dfrac{W}{t}$â€‹, where W is the work done, and t is the time taken.
   Situation 1 is 10 W
   Situation 2 is 12.5 W.
3. By increasing power, we can increase the force applied or the distance.
4. We can use the formula $P=\dfrac{W}{t}$ 
   $P=\dfrac{10000J}{50min \times 60s/min}$
5. Pull the wagon with the handle as close to horizontal as possible. 
6. $W = F \times d$
$W = 1000kg \times 9.8N/s^2  \times 146m$=1430800J
7. We can use $W = F \times d$
$W = 9800N \times 145m=1421000J$
$W = 9800N \times 290m=2842000J$
