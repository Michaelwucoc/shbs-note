net force 

|Force|Symbol|Definition|Direction|
|---|---|---|---|
|$Friction$|$F_1$|The contact force that opposes sliding motion between surfaces|Parallel to the surface and opposite the sliding direction.|
|$Normal$|$F_N$|The contact force and exerted by a surface on an object|Perpendicular to and away from the end.|
|$Spring$|$F_{SP}$|A restoring force; that is the push or pull a spring exerts on an object|Opposite the displacement of the object at the end of spring.|

# Newton's first law of Motion
An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object that is moving will continue to move in a straight line with constant speed, if and only if the net force acting on that object is zero.

# Friction
Friction is the force that brings nearly everything to a stop, and the force that acts to resist sliding between two touching surfaces.

# Friction
## Static Friction
When two objects are at rest or attempting to move relative to each other, there is a force that prevents their motion. This force is called static friction. The magnitude of static friction depends on the roughness of the contact surfaces and the applied force. An object remains at rest until the applied force is equal to or greater than the static friction force.
## Sliding Friction
When two objects are sliding against each other, there is a force that acts to reduce their motion. This force is called sliding friction. The magnitude of sliding friction is generally smaller than static friction.
u\
## Rolling Friction
When a cylindrical object or a wheel is rolling on a surface, there is a force that slows down its motion. This force is called rolling friction. Rolling friction is usually smaller than both static friction and sliding friction.
