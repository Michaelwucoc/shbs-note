1. The pressure at the bottom of a column of liquid is directly proportional to the density of the liquid and the height of the column, but not the diameter. Therefore, if the pressure at the bottom of each column is the same, the heights of the two columns will be inversely proportional to their respective diameters. 

2. The height of the liquid column in a barometer changes as atmospheric pressure changes due to the balance between the weight of the liquid column and the atmospheric pressure pushing down on the liquid in the reservoir. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the weight of the liquid column is less opposed, causing it to rise and vice versa.

3. Classifying the given substances:
   - Fluids: warm butter, liquid nitrogen, neon gas
   - Solids: paper, ice

4. The pressure at any point within a fluid is the same in all directions. For a given fluid, the pressure at the bottom of a container depends only on the height of the fluid above that point and the fluid's density, not the container's shape.

5. As a balloon rises higher in the atmosphere, the external atmospheric pressure decreases. The pressure inside the balloon remains relatively constant, causing the gas inside the balloon to expand, which increases the balloon's diameter.

6. Applying the formula: 
   $Pressure = \dfrac{Force}{Area}$
   Rearranging for Force:
  $Force = Pressure \times Area$
   Given:
   $Area = 0.0135 m^2$
   $Atmospheric pressure = 100,000 N/m^2$
   Substituting values:
   $Force = 100,000 N/m^2 \times 0.0135 m^2$
 $Force = 1350 N$


Therefore, the force exerted by the atmosphere on the person's palm is 1350 Newtons.
