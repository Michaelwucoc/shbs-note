1. The units of force, specifically in the International System of Units (SI), are expressed in kilogram-meter per second squared (kg・m/s^2), often referred to as a "newton" (N). This unit is derived from Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. By substituting the units for mass (kg) and acceleration (m/s^2) into the equation, we get the unit of force as kg・m/s^2.

2. Mass refers to the amount of matter in an object and is measured in kilograms (kg). It is a scalar quantity and remains constant regardless of the object's location. On the other hand, weight is the gravitational force exerted on an object due to its mass and the gravitational pull of the planet it is on. Weight is measured in newtons (N) and can vary depending on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight is a vector quantity and its value depends on the gravitational acceleration at a particular location.

3. An object will accelerate (speed up or slow down) when an unbalanced force is applied to it. According to Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass. If the net force acts in the same direction as the object's motion, it will speed up. If the net force acts in the opposite direction to the object's motion, it will slow down.

4. An object changes its direction when an external force is applied perpendicular to its current velocity. According to Newton's first law of motion (the law of inertia), an object will continue moving in a straight line with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, when a force is applied perpendicular to the object's velocity, it causes the object to change its direction while keeping the magnitude of its velocity constant.

5. Yes, an object can experience circular motion when a centripetal force acts upon it. A centripetal force is a force that acts towards the center of the circular path, causing the object to continuously change its direction. This force is required to keep the object moving in a circular path instead of moving in a straight line. Some examples of creating circular motion include swinging a pendulum, spinning an object attached to a string, or the gravitational force keeping planets in orbit around the Sun.
