## What is work?
Work is done when a force causes an object to move in the same
direction that the force is applied.
apply a force to an object the object must move in the same direction as your applied force
$work (in joules) = force (in newtons) Â· distance (in meters)$

$W = Fd$

## What is power?
Power is how quickly work is done.
$P=\dfrac {W}{t}$
## Work and Energy
You increase the kinetic energy of an object by making it move.
## Power and Energy
Power is always the rate at which energy is transferred, or the amount of energy transferred divided by the time needed.

# 4.2
## What is a machine?
A machine is simply a device that makes doing work easier.
No matter what type of machine is used, the output work is never greater than the input work.
## Efficiency
For a real machine, the output work done by the machine is always less than the input work that is done on the machine.
## Where does the energy go?
Friction converts some of the input work into heat, so that the output work is reduced.

# 4.3
## Simple machine
A simple machine is a machine that does work with only one movement.
## Compound machine
A machine made up of a combination of simple machines is called a compound machine.
